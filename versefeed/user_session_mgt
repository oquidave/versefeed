//========Submit Quiz ==============
User can submit in a random question or a themed quiz

#random question
user submits in a question that can be one or two or more but that's not themed or categorized. 
however, user must add at least a tag to the question. 

when user submits a question, enter them into the questions db, with; 
	*the question
	*the objectives
	*the question tag(s)
when user clicks on submit, add the qn and choices in the Qns & Themes model, then in the 
Tags & QnsTags model. 
 >> looks like we've to add the authors details somewhere. maybe i need to create a users' qns table
which will map users and their qns. Need the UserQns model with user_id and qn_id foreign keys. 
that way, we can keep track of the users' questions/themes

user can also add a themed quiz like the App themed quized. These are a bit more detailed and more comprehensive. These will require a minimum of 10 questions. 

users' submitted questions will appear under the random category or perhaps call it community while themed questions will appear on the home page like the versebyte themed quizes
